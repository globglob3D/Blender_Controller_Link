# BCL - Blender Controller Link

**BCL (Blender Controller Link)** is a Blender add-on that lets you use a game controller or gamepad as a real-time input device inside Blender. It turns controller inputs into animatable properties that can drive bones, geometry nodes, object transforms, and more â€” enabling intuitive, physical control for animation, rig testing, live performances, and procedural systems.

## Features

- Real-time input from supported game controllers
- Maps axes and buttons to any property using drivers
- Control objects, rigs, and geometry nodes with physical input
- Record inputs directly as keyframes on the timeline
- No setup needed
- Lightweight, fast, and non-intrusive

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP of this repository.
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
