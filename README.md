# Controller Link

**Controller Link** is a Blender add-on that lets you use a game controller or gamepad as a real-time input device. It turns controller inputs into animatable properties that can drive bones, geometry nodes, object transforms, and more â€” enabling intuitive, physical control for animation, rig testing, live performances, and procedural systems.

## Features

- Live and record gamepad inputs
- Link to Geometry Nodes
- Works with any gamepad
- Work on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP of this repository.
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
3. Click **Install...** and select the ZIP file.
4. Enable **Controller Link** in the list.

## Usage

Go the Controller Link tab and click the button to get your controller inputs.
Drivers: Right click a controller input property, copy as driver, and right click any property that you want driven by this input and Paste Driver.
GN: Just add the Controller Link node group to your tree.
You can record inputs if you wish. 
Once you record your inputs, you can use the Bake Animation operator (native to Blender) to keep that recording and be able to make a new one without overriding your work.

## Requirements

- Blender 4.4 or newer
